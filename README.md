## Tasks

1. Using [openweatherapi](https://openweathermap.org/api) (Don't worry it's free) build an API with the following two routes
	* GET route: Get the weather based on the `city`. This includes the high, low, and weather description. Since the
	weather changes throughout the day get the weather description closest to the current time. The response to the user should be in JSON format.
	* GET route: Get the forecast based on the `city` and the `numberDay`. Ex "What is the four day forecast in Tokyo?". This should respond with data
	about the high, low, and weather description for each day.
2. Using any technology desired build a front end that makes these calls and displays the data from part one.

**Bonus Level: Write some tests for your API, even one would be nice to see, but not required. We are a test driven shop!**

**NOTE:**
We're looking for organized coders. Files architected in a way in which the application could be scaled to engulf multiple APIs from multiple sources. 
This is your opportunity to blow us out of the water! Don't forget error handling! Good luck! Happy coding :)
